# Guess_Pokemon

A simple python tkinter GUI based game for helping you test and enhance your memory for pokemon's names.

## Getting Started


[shape_similarity.py](https://github.com/soulzqm/Guess_Pokemon/blob/master/shape_similarity.py), [getfilled](https://github.com/soulzqm/Guess_Pokemon/blob/master/getfilled.py) and [getrs.py](https://github.com/soulzqm/Guess_Pokemon/blob/master/getrs.py) are only used for pre-processing the raw pokemon PNG images. 
[presentation](https://github.com/soulzqm/Guess_Pokemon/blob/master/presentation.pptx) illustrates the concepts and procedure details to build the game.
[Guess_Pokemon.zip](https://megaupload.nz/a8qbrfkdn3/Guess_Pokemon_zip) contains the all raw pokemon png images, processed images, [name list](https://github.com/soulzqm/Guess_Pokemon/blob/master/pokemonlist.txt) and codes necessary to run the game. (See Installing)

### Prerequisites

### Installing

Please download the [Guess_Pokemon.zip](https://megaupload.nz/a8qbrfkdn3/Guess_Pokemon_zip) (300MB) just for the game. You can extract it to wherever you want. However, you need to set the path where you put your extracted folder in the file [Guess_Pokemon.py](https://github.com/soulzqm/Guess_Pokemon/blob/master/Guess_Pokemon.py) (line15) by editing:

```
