# Guess_Pokemon

A simple python tkinter GUI based game for helping you test and enhance your memory for pokemon's names.

## Getting Started


[shape_similarity.py](https://github.com/soulzqm/Guess_Pokemon/blob/master/shape_similarity.py), [getfilled]() and [getrs.py]() are only used for pre-processing the raw pokemon PNG images. 
[presentation]() illustrates the concepts and procedure details to build the game.
[Guess_Pokemon.zip] () contains the all raw pokemon png images, processed images, name list and codes necessary to run the game.        (See Installing)

### Prerequisites

Python 2.7 (may not work on 3) and [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.3/index.html) modules installed



### Installing

Please download the [Guess_Pokemon.zip]() just for the game. You can extract it to wherever you want. However, you need to set the path where you put your extracted folder in the file Guess_Pokemon.py (line13) by typing:

```
path = 'the path of your folder/Guess_Pokemon/'
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Tutorial for the game
